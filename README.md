## How it Works ?
1.It is like a normal todo-list or in other words it does the activities of a task manager. we could create tasks with its title, description and head line which makes the user very friendly to interact with.

After the completion of each tasks we could mark the task as complete which indicates the baground of the corresponding task in green colour which makes the user more interactive.
